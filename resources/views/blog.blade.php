            <p>Chinese health officials first reported cases of acute respiratory illness associated with a seafood and animal market in the city of Wuhan on December 31, 2019. A week later, they confirmed that a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was associated with this initial cluster of cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (1) The first confirmed case of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, in the United States was reported on January 21, 2020; by the end of March, the number of cases had climbed to 188,200, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.A “novel” coronavirus (CoV) means it’s a new strain of coronavirus that hasn’t been seen or identified before.</p>

            <p>Coronaviruses can range from a common cold to more serious illnesses, like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Symptoms can be mild, with just a runny nose or cough, but can also become much more serious, including fever and even pneumonia. In some cases, a coronavirus can be fatal, especially in frailer people or those with preexisting medical conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, notes the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
            <p>Types of Coronaviruses</p>
            <p>Human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s, and there are currently seven that can infect people. They include 229E (alpha coronavirus), NL63 (alpha coronavirus), OC43 (beta coronavirus), HKU1 (beta coronavirus), MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, the latest coronavirus to be transmitted to humans.
            It is very common for people around the world to be infected with 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. These viruses usually cause a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness — basically, a common cold, according to the CDC. 
            These coronaviruses can also cause lower respiratory tract illnesses, such as pneumonia and bronchitis. People with cardiopulmonary disease or weaker immune systems, as well as infants and elderly people, are at higher risk, notes the CDC. </p>
            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">2.Easy Ways to Improve Your Relationship With Your Doctor</h2>
            <p>Ask your doctor how electronic health records could help you monitor your health.If you become sick in the middle of the night, you might wake up your spouse, or even let work know you won't be coming in the next day. But some people — at least, those with particularly good relationships with their doctors — might send a quick email over to their physician to let them know what's going on. This sort of interaction may be part of the reason why patients who have good relationships with their doctors tend to have better health outcomes, as a new study found.</p>
            <p>
              <img src="images/image_4.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <p>Logically this makes sense, as people who get along with their doctors are more likely to go and see them, be honest with them, and listen to their advice. The research, conducted by doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital and published in PLOS One, analyzed 13 randomized control trials, in which doctors underwent training to improve how they interacted with patients. If the doctor-patient relationship improved, the patient's health also improved, for example, by increased weight loss or lower blood pressure. In fact, the researchers said the overall improvement seen across the 13 studies was equivalent to to the added boost that taking aspirin daily has on your risk of having a heart attack.</p>
            <p>That a good doctor-patient relationship can improve health outcomes has been shown before, for example in a study that showed diabetic patients are more successful at monitoring their blood sugar when their doctor is more empathetic, said Rodney Tucker, MD, chief experience officer for the University of Alabama at Birmingham Health System who was not involved in the study. Tucker said the finding is "common sense.</p>
            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">3. Why Your Kids Should Still Get Vaccinated During the Coronavirus Pandemic</h2>
            <p>The ongoing COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic has made it difficult to keep up with routine health maintenance, whether that’s non-essential surgery, going to the emergency room or regular visits to your primary health care provider. Given the outbreak, it’s understandable there are a lot of questions about where it’s safe to go and if certain offices are even open. And one area of concern pertains to vaccinations of young children.Fears over COVID-19 infections plus broad and varying “stay-at-home” orders across many states have resulted in a reported decrease in children receiving routine, essential immunizations. Pediatrician Kimberly Giuliano, MD, points out, “Since the onset of the pandemic, national data shows there’s been from a 42 to 73% decline in vaccination rates, depending on the source and vaccine type.Missing these routine vaccinations, though, can be harmful for children, leaving them exposed to numerous other illnesses that carry more risks for them than COVID-19, including measles. We spoke with pediatrician Skyler Kalady, MD, about those risks, concerns over COVID-19, and why parents should make sure their children stay updated on their vaccinations. </p>
            <p>
              <img src="images/child.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <p>While children are at risk for COVID-19, Dr. Kalady says, “Fortunately, studies show that most children who develop COVID-19 have a relatively mild course of illness, or are even asymptomatic, compared to adults.” She adds that parents should continue to prioritize getting their children their routine vaccinations in spite of anxieties over COVID-19.“Vaccine preventable illness are present in our community. It’s really important that we don’t lose sight of these real health threats,” she says. “If children are not vaccinated, they are at high risk for developing those vaccine preventable illnesses, including measles and pertussis (whooping cough).” </p>

              <h3 class="heading-sidebar">How Are Coronaviruses Treated?</h3>
              <p>There is currently no specific treatment for a coronavirus. Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they are only effective in treating bacterial infections. Treating and relieving symptoms is the appropriate care, according to the WHO. People who have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their health provider for further instruction. If you test positive for COVID-19, your doctor will instruct you on how to monitor your symptoms as well as what to do if they worsen.People confirmed to have COVID-19 may be eligible to participate in one of the ongoing clinical trials. </p>
              <h3 class="heading-sidebar">How Can You Prevent Being Infected With a Coronavirus?</h3>
              <p>To minimize your chances of getting a coronavirus, including COVID-19, practice the same habits you would to avoid catching any infectious respiratory virus. Per the CDC, these include:
              Follow federal and local stay-at-home orders. "Stay at home" is pretty self-explanatory: Work and engage in schooling from home if possible and don’t go anywhere that isn’t essential. Avoid social gatherings with groups of more than 10 people.
              Practice social distancing. Keep at least six feet between yourself and others.
              Try not to touch your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
              Practice home isolation if you’re sick. Separate yourself from other people and pets in your home and use a different bathroom if possible.
              If you have to sneeze or cough, cover with a tissue and then dispose of the tissue.
              Clean and disinfect things or surfaces that you touch a lot, such as phones, doorknobs, and countertops.
              Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If you don’t have access to a sink, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol.
              Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when you are around others.</p>
